### Hi there, I'm David. 👋

🏗️ After studying and working as architect in France, I decided to have a career switch for web developer.

🚋 I follow the bootcamp with [@lewagon](https://github.com/lewagon), where during 9 intensive and passioning weeks, I learned Ruby, Ruby on rails, html, css, js, SQL,...

🚀 You can check my last bootcamp project [Skill-Up](https://github.com/DavidML89/Skill_Up_Project) and the website on www.skill-up.xyz

🤝 I'm looking now for a job where I could continue to extend my knowledge.

Besides coding, I love plants 🪴, city tour 🏙️ and to dance 💃.
